# AD3-5-plumbing-code

- Run the script with python >=3.4, use `--help` for usage manual. 
- Change the parameter you use for statistics output in the code (the `-p` as mentioned in the assignment) to whatever you use
- The outputted statistics should be of the form: `runtime steps Î»`
- Returns the results in a csv file :)
  - (there are latex ways to use a csv as tabular data, haven't looked into it yet)
