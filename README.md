# AD3-5-plumbing-code

- Run the script with python >=3.4, use `--help` for usage manual. 
- In the code, change the parameter `--print-stats` to whatever you use as statistics mode flag (in the assignment it's they use `-p`)
- The outputted statistics should be of the form: `runtime steps Î»`
- Returns the results in a csv file :)
  - (there are latex ways to use a csv as tabular data, haven't looked into it yet)
